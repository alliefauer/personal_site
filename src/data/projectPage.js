We get stuck in traffic, get caught up talking to a co-worker while trying to leave the office, or suddenly remember that we should stop to get that one thing we really need at the store. These events can be hard to communicate, and frustrating for family members who are trying to time their activities around your arrival at home.", "To make communication easier, I've created the IoT Location Sensing Picture Frame. The concept is simple. Each family member has a photo of themselves in the picture frame. Each photo has a corresponding strip of lights that is controlled by an app that runs in the background of the designated family member's smart phone (yes...each family member having a smart phone is a pre-requisite for this project.). The lights are programmed to display colors in a spectrum ranging from red to green. If the lights for a certain family member are red, it means that they are far away from home. If the lights are green, it means that they are home. If the lights have been orange for a while, but you notice that they are slowly fading to yellow, the family member is traveling closer to home and the lights will continue to fade to green until that family member arrives at home.", "This project was a runner up in the Intel IoT Invitational on Instructables.com."],
